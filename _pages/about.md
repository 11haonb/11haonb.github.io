# 💬 Other Interests
- I have some other interests apart from my research fields.
- A huge lover of food as well as the culture behind them. Season 1 and 2 of "A Bite of China" is highly recommended. Food culture can be one of the best reflections of a nation's soft power.
- A big fan of 3A games, especially Red Dead Redemption 2 and Legend of Zelda:Breath of the wild since they offer players a high degree of freedom meanwhile maintaining outstanding quality of details.
- An enthusiast of Chinese history, now trying to dive into it and learn history of other countries around the world. History can be a mirror despite we rarely learn any lesson from them.
